To do this we evaluate keyword tuples (Usually an n-gram adds more value when compated to an individual token) of the original sentence using an unsupervised keyword extraction technique like SGRank (elaborated here: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S15-1013). The clauses that contain the n-grams are assigned the score of the n-gram as determined by SG Rank. The quality metric per clause is then determined as Sum(Sgrank values of tuples)/Total tuples with values.\n",
