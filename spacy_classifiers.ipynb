Change for each of us and as a species is product our individual and collective memory of our knowledge and experiences through time. Sometimes the change is thought to be external to ourselves, sometimes it is viewed to be caused by us individually. In some respects change is an illusion of our understanding and experiencing of time.\n",
    "3040\tWhat gets me into trouble is My intellect. My mind is ultra fast and If im not fully in my center, I sometimes jap out something stupid. Because I easily see peoples struggle I can also easily hurt them.. Its a defence programme. It hasn't come up for a while now and I assume I got the better of it. There are many other things that will get me in trouble if I dont attend to my inner self in the for of my spiritual practice\n",
    "3041\tThese days, work from the perspective of the individual, is to reach beyond the confines of the mind, heart and body and use them to sense oneness with the gross, subtle and causal. From the perspective of the one, work is to sense through the specific circumstances of the individual to see where healing is required in the ever-present now and as mentioned above to apply to that location the energy of love and life.\n",
    "3042\tWhen I am criticized I find myself going inward to first examine my response to this criticism, and also the state of my heart. I live from a commitment to have an open mind to the feedback which I receive from the world , with which I am engaged and to be teachable and willing to listen, so that I might learn from others. I acknowledge as well the pain which such criticism creates within the, and allow this pain to teach me as well.\n",
    "3043\tThese days, work is a giving back to the seeds planted by the Kosmic ocean. Through the exchange of the infinite Delight it moves through the \\\"me\\\" and asks for an unfolding of what it give to offer back to the whole. Work is also the causal ocean \\\"out there\\\" moving and calling forth itself from within this swirl, this formMy \\\"i\\\" and work is constituted by the Whole through all layers and levels of concrete, subtle and causal.\n",
    "3044\tRaising a family I salute all those who are raising families and I know that this goes beyond the parents and it takes a village to raise a family - this feels more true these days and I am grateful for lifetimes of families and generations of families and ancestors who have played a part in raising me. While I will not be raising my own family,I do feel that I contribute to raising individuals by my presence and interaction with them.\n",
    "3045\tWhen I am criticized it is one face of divinity noticing separation and responding. Every movement is a movement of an Ocean reaching into concrete, sublet and causal forms. it swirls at different rates which hold different noticingwe see what we have not loved and embraced as the ocean of delight. When someone see my form and shape and criticizes it, it is the divine looking at me and emendating its beauty towards itself in the collective.\n",
    "3046\tLove changes when First, when there is a connectiononeness that unites consciousness, heart and body so that the localized and the infinite are experienced simultaneously. And second, when one feels the ability to shift the cosmic flow of life and love and direct some of its healing power where it is needed, either within the deepest essence of a loved one, a person in need, toward a global tragedy, or a world view or meme that is doing harm.\n",
    "3047\tI am the voice at the edge of hearing, the movement in the corner of the eye, the novelty that makes you smile, the light in the darkness, and the nothingness at the heart of it all. I am the string, the wave, the field, the packet of energy. I am the watcher, the smiler, the laughter and the lover. I am the non-doer, the finger flowing through the air. The symbol and the sign. I am the deep belly laugh that brings forth existence.\n",
    "3048\tWhen I am criticized I can have a range of responses depending upon how tired or resourceful I am or how closely what amnd how they say it matches a previous wound trigger. I can react defensively or just ask why they say that or as I often do ask them to \"say more\" so that I can more completely understand what they are saying so that I can fully understand their point of view, the context from which they formulated their thought and learn from it.\n",
    "3049\tBusiness and society need a new social contract. They coexist with a great deal of tension in a capitalist structure and shareholders win out at the expense of the workers, the environment, and the community at large. Business needs to be in the \\\"business\\\" of generating value not wealth and operating within the constraints of our natural environment or actually contributing to better stewardship of the resources we have so we dont destroy ourselves.\n",
    "3050\tWhen I am criticized I know there is something I must have missed, something I haven\\'t noticed or a dynamic at work that is causing the person criticizing me to see in me a gap of some sort. And while that gap may or may not be there in reality, it is in that person\\'s mind. This provides me the opportunity to explore that person\\'s mind or world view. I would like that exploration to result in growth for us both or at least to enhance our relationship.\n",
    "3051\tCrime and delinquency could be halted if we could see that the essence of who we are in unity and in variation are two side of one coin of WholnessIF we could see all \\\"other\\\" as our very own self, we could become privy to a Love that heals, that gently embraces the ways an Eternity postures and veils itself as a separation. in this embrace, the separation melts, because God is embraced at any level it shows its beautiful facein that embrace we feel heard and we feel whole...\n",
    "3052\tIf my mother I feel a pull to look back at my own upbringing and my mother's inevitable influence on my development. I am also aware of having moved beyond dwelling on unfinished business and see how much a trap that is for the ego and my identifying with the unmet need. I suppose if my mother had been different I might have had different hang ups, but as I believe now I am the only one who can do anything about them, it feels a bit immaterial right now.\n",
    "3053\tThese days, work Is something I continue to enjoy and take great pleasure in using it as a framework within which to continue my journey of discovery and fulfilment. Work is not separate to life. Work is part of living, of serving, of being useful. Indeed, one could call work - play. There is no separation. Whether I receive the appropriate value recognition or remuneration for my \"job\" is my judgement. Voluntary work, while unpaid, is the most rewarding, I find.\n",
    "3054\tChange is the shittiest fucking thing ever; I so wish reality was completely static sometimes... at least, so says some part of me, at least right now - the thirst for permanence comes in waves, and it's pretty strong in me today... did I mention I'm wrestling with a couple of big and difficult life changes at the moment? :-) This is not representative of how I usually respond to this stem or talk about change, it's just what I'm present to at the moment...\n",
    "3055\tBeing with other people Is being nested within the eternal field that moves through and within everything. Charged as though all animate and inanimate forms are breathing, being breathed by the causal whole, so too, being with other people is being with all forms and the divine currents that extend Everywhere. It is like feeling and seeing the Divine Eternity at eternal play within itself; the One through the many as we all dance as fullness, nested within a eternal expanse...\n",
    "3056\tMy main problem is being in my head rather than fully present and instead running trauma patterns habitsbeliefs of being a victim, feeling I need to please others and abandon myself and then be angry when not cared for by others. The other main problem is not fitting in to the \"popular Culture\" world as I am often \"too deep\" seeing metaphorical symbolism and duplicityinauthenticity all around me and wanting to serve and be one with spirit rather then pursuing material things.\n",
    "3057\tPrivacy What can universal consciousness possibly conceive as 'private'...big laugh :) Still laughing :) :) This is hilarious. Everything is seen and is 'it' all of consciousness. In the localised expression of consciousness (as humans) at some levels and stages of development this is a great concern as it shows the humanity of fear, power, manipulation etc, all of which our evolution conspires to create (and also withhold its potential for unfolding). And this is so.\n",
    "3058\tChange is ...happening each day on the one side: kids grow, you realise you get older and remember less, circumstances of living are different today, then yesterday. So you need to \\\"change\\\" your plan of today, you need to be open and flexibel and adopt to it, for example. Changes of behaviour or values demand go much depper and need to be reflected first. It can enter in new developments, but it is difficult to achieve this - personal as well as from the perspective of a society.\n",
    "3059\tMy main problem is trying to \\'wrestle with the angel\\'. The Vision is so Vast, there is no way that my human mind can \\'wrap itself around it\\'. It doesn\\'t know how. Interestingly, my virtual assistant, Melanie Davis, whom I\\'ve never met \\'face to face\\', brought to my awareness the Mission of Called By Love Institute when she said that the two people who are part of our core team working on building the new website seem to be doing it! The Mission calls it \\'Harnessing the Power of Love\\'\n",
    "3060\tMy co-workers and I My co-workers in the evolution of consciousness are members of 3 weekly weekly generative dialog groups. Together we enter shared containers of collective consciousness and collective heart. We explore who we are in this space and what is possible. We let go of our individual (subtle) egos and we practice trying on and owning identities grounded in more expansive perspectives. The ultimate goal is to share a planetary or Kosmic identity and once aligned, see what we can accomplish together as one.\"\"\")\n",
