A good boss, is the teenager that rebels against his or her family collective and the 28 year old who gives up knowing everything and begins to learn something. A good boss is everywhere as threads of the eternal ocean articulating itself in infinite ways; a multiplicity of faces, qualities, perspectives and capacity for perspective taking. The embodiment of the first person perspective is a good boss as is an embodiment of the 7th person perspective.
