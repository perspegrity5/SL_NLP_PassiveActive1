    "### Introduction to Computing the clause's overall quality\n",
    "This part determines how each clause adds importance to the overall intent of the sentence. To do this we evaluate keyword tuples (Usually an n-gram adds more value when compated to an individual token) of the original sentence using an unsupervised keyword extraction technique like SGRank (elaborated here: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S15-1013). The clauses that contain the n-grams are assigned the score of the n-gram as determined by SG Rank. The quality metric per clause is then determined as Sum(Sgrank values of tuples)/Total tuples with values.\n",
