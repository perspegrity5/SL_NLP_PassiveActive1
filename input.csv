My mind is a cacophony of changing opinions, changing beliefs, and changing perspectives and I witness its various voices going in and out of consciousness.  My body changes its chemistry, composition, shape and health by the second.  My relationships change as I continuously get to know my friends, my partners, my children and family deeper and deeper.  And yet, there is a constant of universal energy that I, and many, label as \&quot;God\&quot; -- or \&quot;Universal Energy\&quot; or many other labels.  This energy seems to be ever present, not susceptible to the thermodynamics of energy conversation that the rest of us are.  It is an energy that seems to have unchanging wisdom and love.

Every face, context, emotional, mental, and causal articulation, is the One ocean weaving its vast impregnated soul in a myriad of nuances. Every face is one collective motion through all levels all layer of concrete, subtle causal. Every face is the One eternal face. Raising a family is the Divine-as-parent embracing the Divine-as-child, both embracing as Godhead and becoming each nuanced heart of the illusion of other.

He or she can \&#039;slide\&#039; into multiple perspectives and qualities of being, and stage perspectives simultaneously, while at the same time identify with something beyond these perspectives and qualities. A good boss is moved and constituted by the Source. Actions are initiated by a following forth of a fullness emerging from a Wholeness, moving through the boss and forming the boss. Knowings come straight from the causal whole, about how to move and about the complex dynamics that arise within group life. The \&#039;call\&#039; is the natural resting into the ever-present Ocean of Delight. The response is the causal sacred heart that exists through the outside to the inside and vice versa interpenetrating with and illuminating the actions of the individual in the form of a boss. But to stop here, portrays an image of unity as a veil separate from the unity within division. A good boss is an uprightness that is expressed through every stage of development, through multiple faces as the causal wholeness moves through and forms the multiple layers of the collective &#x28;concrete, subtle, causal, and beyond&#x29;. A good boss could never be an expression of one perspective, even a huge perspective, even a unity perspective. To do that renders the unity perspective incomplete and divided. A good boss is the stone that emanates antiquity and profound spaciousness. A good boss is the tree that grows towards the sun. A good boss, is the squirrel that remains forever committed to the qualities of squirrel. A good boss is the six year old that cares for the two year old and the infant who cries out in need. A good boss, is the teenager that rebels against his or her family collective and the 28 year old who gives up knowing everything and begins to learn something. A good boss is everywhere as threads of the eternal ocean articulating itself in infinite ways; a multiplicity of faces, qualities, perspectives and capacity for perspective taking. The embodiment of the first person perspective is a good boss as is an embodiment of the 7th person perspective. The good Boss is the whole thing, the entire fullness, across its whole spectrum; a simultaneous impregnation of the One through the Many; a simultaneous expression of a unity as a multiplicity as a unity.",6.0,31,

Feeling into \&#039;another\&#039;s\&#039; world is the same as feeling into \&#039;one\&#039;s own\&#039; world, because they are the same collective world. There is only one mind that we live through, only one spirit, only one emotional landscape. And it belongs to all of us, although some are blind to it, while some of us step into the collective treasury. In this wide heart, the entire kosmos is within us and we are within it simultaneously.

Although I can slide into any epistemology directly, the place within which my singular \&quot;I\&quot; rests, and is merged with is beyond the need to make meaning and hence, there are no problems. Any issue wanting completion, fruition, exploration, arises in the moment as the Causal Whole constitutes itself through the concrete, subtle, and causal bodies.

The anger in \&#039;me\&#039; is the same as the anger in anyone of us; we are all portals into the collective domain of emotion, mind, soul, and spirit. When anger arises I identify with the causal rain; the causal territory that is above, around, within, without, the place beyond time. My interior witness, watches the anger, my interior witness merges and identifies with the Causal Whole that is everywhere, inside and outside and all around. It also identifies with the anger. there is a simultaneous identification with the Divine Sacred Heart in multiple faces, as wholeness on the inside, wholeness on the outside, wholeness that runs through everything and spans an eternity. And wholeness that appears as division in the form of anger. The anger wants fruition, as does all postures prior to a full identification with unity. Unity does not favor and experience of wholeness over an experience of division because for Unity, anger is just as much the whole as is bliss. The whole, embraces the anger as would an enlightened guru embrace their disciples. The anger, in the process of being held by infinite light and love from every direction begins to soften and show its vulnerability. It then softens even more and becomes liberated. Anger is something from the whole that desires liberation and fruition. It becomes held by something that does not seek liberation and is the embodiment of fruition. Anger is a unity veiled as a non-unity. It wants to merge back into it origin. \&#039;I\&#039; become all of these things simultaneously, which is actually all of it identifying with all of it.",6.0,15,

The world is filled with so many of us that still want to make meaning and want to use their will to become a perpetual unfolding and fruition. Life, and the mystery it pours out of wants this. For me, this needs has gone. I don\&#039;t need to know things, to create things, to will things. I will engage in that if life asks it of me, and very often it does, but for me, just sitting still, merging with the permeating gentle arms of that which fills all space with Love and allowing what is to be what is, is what feels best. With so much of the mind-of-God-as-fullness engaging in making meaning, I don\&#039;t need to participate, per se. that part of me &#x28;the multiple collectives of concrete, subtle, causal fullness&#x29; is participating just fine and has been for billions of years.

I choose my response, either by design or default, and I can see when those choices and decisions work for me and for others, and when they don't.  As I reflect and spend more time with the criticism, I sit with and open up to the varying perspectives of any given situation or circumstance, their offerings, and how I might integrate this new understanding moving forward.
